#1.Identify Bias: Determine the potential sources of bias in the column. This could be related to factors such as underrepresentation of certain groups, unequal distribution of values, or systemic errors in data collection.

#2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of values in the column across different groups. Look for any patterns or disparities that may indicate bias.

#3.Bias Metrics: Use bias metrics to quantify the extent of bias present in the column. This could involve calculating statistical measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, or proportions for different groups.

#4.Mitigation Techniques: Implement mitigation techniques to address bias in the column. Depending on the nature of bias, possible techniques include:

@Data preprocessing: Apply techniques such as normalization, standardization, or resampling to balance the distribution of values.
@Subgroup analysis: Analyze the data separately for different subgroups to identify and address disparities.
@Algorithmic adjustments: Modify algorithms or models to account for bias, such as adjusting weights or thresholds.
@Evaluation: Evaluate the effectiveness of the mitigation techniques by comparing bias metrics before and after implementation. Continuously monitor the column for any changes or new biases that may arise.
